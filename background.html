    <h1>Optimize a 1 cm Solar Cell Grid</h1>

    <p>
      When sunlight strikes a solar cell, it energizes electrons in the solar cell material, creating electricity. But those energized electrons still have a long way to travel before they can power a phone, a car, or a factory. They must escape the solar cell material, leave the solar panel, then traverse wires - sometimes for miles - before reaching their point of use! The first thing electrons must do is seek out a collection of small wires on the solar cell surface called a "grid" that let them all travel to a few exit points in the cell that lead to wires - let's call those points the "sinks".
    </p><p>
      Today's solar panels use grids made of transparent conducting materials (indium tin oxide is common) and straight metal lines. But there's a problem - these materials must sit on top of the solar cell where they cast a shadow, reducing the cell's power output. Solar cell designers must balance two sources of power loss: make the grid too large and its shadow hurts power output (shadow loss). Make the grid too small and the electrons shed energy just moving through the wires (series resistance loss). On this page is a tool to help balance these two losses by finding grid designs that give the highest possible power return - this is an "optimization" problem.
    </p><p>
      While we were at it, we built in a couple of enhancements compared to commercial solar cells. First, we allowed wires to become very small - down to 5 microns, or 1/20th the width of a human hair, to reflect the cutting edge capabilities of additive grid manufacturing technology. Second, we allowed the wires in the simulation to go wherever they want, not just in straight lines. We were inspired by nature's solar cells: leaves! Leaf veins grow in complex branching networks that concentrate energy in a few large "highway" veins which are more efficient. Our network tends to do the same thing, resulting (we hope) in more efficient networks!
    </p><p>
      But the most difficult challenge remains: where exactly should you place the wires to get the most power? There are near infinite possible patterns. This simulation will gather current from a 1cm x 1cm solar cell. It knows how to route and scale its wires to seek out good power returns, but it needs help defining the "mesh" it will grow on. The mesh is a series of points that simulate the power generated by the underlying solar cell.
    </p><p>
      <strong>Click in the window to add a point to the mesh!</strong> Each point will collect current and send it along with a wire to one of its neighbors.
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Point <strong>size</strong> indicates how much solar cell area it gathers from.</li>
	<li>Point <strong>color</strong> indicates the "differential power" value - this is a signal the network uses to decide which nodes have the best access to a <strong>sink</strong>.</li>
	<li>Wire <strong>width</strong> indicates the wire thickness, determined automatically.</li>
	<li>Wire <strong>color</strong> indicates how much electric current is flowing through that wire, from low (white) to high (red).</li>
	<li>Each point in the mesh wants to get current to a <strong>sink.</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </p><p>
      <strong>Double click in the window to add a "sink" to the mesh.</strong> Sinks don't create any current themselves - in fact they cost some power from contact losses - but they serve as targets for the rest of the mesh. To use the power generated by the cell, electricity must get routed to a sink. Sinks appear as triangles in the simulation; one will be placed randomly every time you generate a new mesh.
    </p><p>
      The theoretical - but practically impossible - power output of this cell is 24 milliwatts. By trying different layouts, and by adding points and sinks, how much power can you squeeze out of the solar cell?
